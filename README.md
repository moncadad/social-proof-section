### What I learned

HTML: No code provided but overall pretty proud of the implementation of each component.
I feel like the structured used in this project the "breaking down", and reduction of code was something I felt proud of.

CSS: I think this project served as a refresher to better understand layout, background positioning thanks to MDN. This project got me thinking about selecting for example > where and when to use this. I spent about an half an hour looking for the bug, and a wrong selction was the issue.

```css
body {
  font-weight: 15px;
  font-family: var(--font-league);
  background-image: url(../public/images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg),
    url(../public/images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg);
  background-position: top left, bottom right;
}
```

### Continued development

I shall continue learning JSX and how to make my code much more dynamic.
Also I seem to have forgotten how to use loops so I will be revisiting that! Another thing to get better at would be css I think my responsiveness could use some help. Oh and background-image properties continue to kick my butt, I shall make it another think I get better at.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me for background properties.
- [Resource 2](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/) - Helpful resource to learn responsiveness that I have began and may help someone.
